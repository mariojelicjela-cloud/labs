# 🧑‍💻 What is [AI Engineering](https://maven.com/aimakerspace/ai-eng-bootcamp)?

AI Engineering refers to the industry-relevant skills that data science and engineering teams need to successfully **build, deploy, operate, and improve Large Language Model (LLM) applications in production environments.**

In 2026, AI Engineers are responsible for building agents.

[Agent Engineering](https://blog.langchain.com/agent-engineering-a-new-discipline/), an emerging discipline, is defined as the iterative process of refining non-deterministic LLM systems into reliable production experiences.

In practice, Agent Engineering requires understanding how to prototype and productionize.

During the *prototyping* phase, we want to have the skills to:

1. Deploy End-to-End LLM Applications to Users
2. Build Agentic RAG Applications
3. Build Deep Agents
4. Build Multi-Agent Applications
5. Monitor Agentic RAG Applications
6. Build and Implement Evals for Agentic RAG Applications
7. Improve Retrieval Pipelines

When *productionizing*, we want to make sure we have the skills to:

1. Build Agents with Production-Grade Components
2. Deploy Production Agent Servers
3. Deploy Production LLM Servers
4. Deploy MCP Servers
   
# 🏆 **Certification**

To become a **Certified AI Engineer,** follow these steps: [The AI Engineering Bootcamp Certification](https://www.notion.so/The-AI-Engineering-Bootcamp-Certification-256cd547af3d808a9c95e8f6efb8fb5a?pvs=21) 

TL;DR

- ≥ 85% on all assignments, cumulative (grading rubric is being updates for cohort 9!)
- ✅ Certification Challenge (see [The Certification Challenge Rubric from Cohort 8](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_sV7MuHj674BikQ4Fe1QYiGVUTaBybL3ND5IN2ILq3Q/edit?gid=278684736#gid=278684736))
- ✅ Demo Day (see [Demo Day Selection Process](https://www.notion.so/Demo-Day-Selection-Process-254cd547af3d80258d06d48693bd5ec3) for more information)

If you do not complete the above requirements or maintain a high-quality standard of work, you may still be eligible for a *certificate of completion* if you miss no more than 2 live sessions.
