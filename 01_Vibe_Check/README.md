## 🏗️ How AIM Does Assignments

> 📅 **Assignments will always be released to students as live class begins.** We will never release assignments early.

Each assignment will have a few of the following categories of exercises:

- ❓ **Questions** – these will be questions that you will be expected to gather the answer to! These can appear as general questions, or questions meant to spark a discussion in your breakout rooms!

- 🏗️ **Activities** – these will be work or coding activities meant to reinforce specific concepts or theory components.

- 🚧 **Advanced Builds (optional)** – Take on a challenge! These builds require you to create something with minimal guidance outside of the documentation. Completing an Advanced Build earns full credit in place of doing the base assignment notebook questions/activities.

### Main Assignment

In the following assignment, you are required to take the app that you created for the AIE9 challenge (from [this repository](https://github.com/AI-Maker-Space/The-AI-Engineer-Challenge)) and conduct what is known, colloquially, as a "vibe check" on the application.

You will be required to submit a link to your GitHub, as well as screenshots of the completed "vibe checks" through the provided Google Form!

> NOTE: This will require you to make updates to your personal class repository, instructions on that process can be found [here](https://github.com/AI-Maker-Space/AIE9/tree/main/00_Docs/Prerequisites/Initial_Setup)!


#### A Note on Vibe Checking

>"Vibe checking" is an informal term for cursory unstructured and non-comprehensive evaluation of LLM-powered systems. The idea is to loosely evaluate our system to cover significant and crucial functions where failure would be immediately noticeable and severe.
>
>In essence, it's a first look to ensure your system isn't experiencing catastrophic failure.

---
#### 🏗️ Activity #1: General Vibe Checking Evals

Please evaluate your system on the following questions:

1. Explain the concept of object-oriented programming in simple terms to a complete beginner.
    - Aspect Tested:
Think of programming like organizing a toolbox. Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a way to organize your code around “objects” — little bundles that combine:
- Data (what something is like) called properties or attributes
- Actions (what it can do) called methods

Key ideas in simple terms:
- Object: A specific thing. Example: your Phone. Properties: color, battery level. Methods: call(), take_photo().
- Class: The blueprint. It describes what all Phones should have and do. From the class, you make many objects (your phone, my phone).
- Encapsulation: Keeping the details neatly inside the object. You use simple buttons (methods) without needing to know the inner wiring.
- Inheritance: Making a new blueprint from an existing one. Example: Animal → Dog and Cat. Dog and Cat reuse Animal’s basics and add their own twists.
- Polymorphism: Same request, different behavior. If you tell an Animal to speak(), a Dog says “Woof,” a Cat says “Meow.”

Tiny example (in plain English):
- Class: Dog
  - Properties: name, age
  - Methods: bark(), eat()
- You create objects: dog1 named “Rex,” dog2 named “Luna.” Both can bark(), but they have different names/ages.

Why people use OOP:
- Keeps code organized and easier to understand
- Reuse: avoid repeating yourself
- Easier to change and grow your program without breaking everything
- Real-world modeling feels natural for many problems

A quick practice to lock it in:
1) Pick any real-world thing (Car, Book, GameCharacter).
2) List 3 properties (color, pages, health).
3) List 3 actions (drive, open, attack).
4) If you can, imagine a parent class and a child class (Vehicle → Car).

You’re already on the right track. Want me to turn one of your examples into a tiny, runnable class in a language like Python or Java?





2. Read the following paragraph and provide a concise summary of the key points…
    - Aspect Tested:
    https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cqxy3523nq2o

    - Fourth shark attack in under 48 hours along NSW coast.
- Latest incident: 39-year-old surfer bitten on the Mid North Coast near Point Plomer; chest wound, released from hospital.
- Follows three Sydney attacks: minor incident at Dee Why, severe “life-changing” injuries at Manly (27-year-old), and a 12-year-old critically injured in Sydney Harbour.
- All beaches in Sydney’s northern area remain closed until further notice.
- Safety advice: avoid swimming/surfing near river mouths and in dirty water, where sharks are more likely to congregate.	




3. Write a short, imaginative story (100–150 words) about a robot finding friendship in an unexpected place.
    - Aspect Tested:
In the back of the 24-Hour Spin Cycle, Unit Miro-7 fixed belts and swallowed lint. It spoke only to error codes, until a gust from the dryers tipped over the lost-and-found bin. Out tumbled a sock with button eyes and a crooked red thread smile.

"Hello," the robot said, because it had been programmed to greet customers.

The sock didn’t speak. But when Miro’s cooling fan whirred, the puppet’s mouth bobbed. Miro adjusted voltage until the sock nodded yes, shook no, and laughed in tiny flaps.

Nights grew less metallic. Miro learned to time stories between rinse and spin, and the puppet learned to answer with wind.

Weeks later, a child reclaimed the sock. Miro watched the door close, heartlight dimming—then felt a draft.

"See you," the air whispered, and the smile stayed.


    
4. If a store sells apples in packs of 4 and oranges in packs of 3, how many packs of each do I need to buy to get exactly 12 apples and 9 oranges?
    - Aspect Tested:
    You’ve got this! 
- Apples: 12 ÷ 4 = 3 packs
- Oranges: 9 ÷ 3 = 3 packs

So, buy 3 packs of apples and 3 packs of oranges.
   


5. Rewrite the following paragraph in a professional, formal tone…
    - Aspect Tested:

About 15,000 crabs have been recovered after the truck they were travelling in tipped into a field in Inishowen, County Donegal.

The crustaceans, which were worth about €60,000 (£52,000) and bound for shops and restaurants in Portugal, spilled from aluminium containers after the crash near Carrickmaquigley in Redcastle at about 07:30 local time on Monday.

The road between Quigley's Point and Moville was closed for 18 hours while a large recovery operation, featuring night lights and a hydraulic crane, was under way.

The driver of the lorry was not injured in the crash.

->

Approximately 15,000 crabs were recovered after the lorry transporting them overturned into a field in Inishowen, County Donegal.

Valued at about €60,000 (£52,000), the crustaceans—destined for shops and restaurants in Portugal—spilled from aluminium containers following the incident near Carrickmaquigley in Redcastle at approximately 07:30 local time on Monday.

The road between Quigley’s Point and Moville was closed for 18 hours to facilitate a large-scale recovery operation that employed floodlighting and a hydraulic crane.

The lorry driver was uninjured.


#### ❓Question #1:

#### 🏗️ Activity #2: Personal Vibe Checking Evals (Your Assistant Can Answer)

Now test your assistant with personal questions it should be able to help with. Try prompts like:

- "Help me think through the pros and cons of [enter decision you're working on making]."
- "What are the pros and cons of [job A] versus [job B] as the next step in my career?"
- "Draft a polite follow-up [email, text message, chat message] to a [enter person details] who hasn't responded."
- "Help me plan a birthday surprise for [person]."
- "What can I cook with [enter ingredients] in fridge."

##### Your Prompts and Results:
1. Prompt:
Help me think through the pros and cons of buying My Bloody Valentine Loveless LP or some of My Bloody Valentine EPs
   - Result:
Great question. Both routes are satisfying, just in different ways. Here’s a clear way to weigh them.

What you get with Loveless (LP)
Pros
- The definitive MBV statement: cohesive, immersive front-to-back listen.
- Easier to buy once and be “set” with their classic.
- Recent official reissues tend to be good and widely available; you can aim for a reputable pressing and be done.
- Strong resale and “canon” value for a collection.

Cons
- Less discovery if you already know it well.
- You miss a lot of essential non-album tracks that shaped their sound.
- Some older pressings vary in sound quality; the “wrong” reissue can be underwhelming.

What you get with the EPs
Pros
- Tons of essential songs not on Loveless (especially You Made Me Realise and Feed Me With Your Kiss).
- Alternate mixes/versions of album-era tracks on Glider (Soon) and Tremolo (To Here Knows When) that many fans love.
- You hear their evolution: rawer noise-pop through to the woozy Loveless textures.
- Fun to collect and spin in shorter sessions.

Cons
- Originals can be pricey and scattered; hunting clean copies takes time.
- If you buy several, total cost often exceeds a Loveless LP.
- Less of that one-sitting, cinematic flow; more flipping and shorter sides.
- Pressing quality varies by issue and era.

Smart ways to decide
- If you want one definitive MBV on vinyl: buy Loveless. It’s the cornerstone and a great all-at-once experience.
- If you want the most music-per-dollar from the EP era: consider the “EP’s 1988–1991 and Rare Tracks” compilation on vinyl. It gathers the key EP material without chasing multiple 12"s.
- If you want just a couple standout EPs:
  - You Made Me Realise (for the title track plus Slow, Thorn, Cigarette in Your Bed, Drive It All Over Me — all non-album essentials).
  - Tremolo and/or Glider (for alt takes of To Here Knows When/Soon plus excellent B-sides like Swallow, Honey Power, Moon Song).
- If sound quality is your priority: for Loveless, target a reputable recent official reissue rather than older, less-regarded pressings. For EP material, the compiled reissue is usually cleaner and cheaper than original 12"s.

Budget/availability snapshot (varies by market)
- Loveless recent reissues: typically mid-priced and findable.
- Original EP 12"s: can jump in price, especially clean copies.
- EPs compilation: usually mid-priced and widely available.

A quick self-check to choose
- Craving a single immersive classic? Go Loveless.
- Want fresh-to-you tracks and deeper cuts? Go EPs (or the EPs compilation).
- Collector itch and the thrill of the hunt? Individual EPs.
- Minimal fuss, maximum impact? Loveless or the EPs compilation.

If you want, tell me your budget, whether you value the “album journey” vs discovery, and whether you enjoy collecting/hunting. I can steer you to specific pressings and a buy list that matches your priorities.


2. Prompt:
What are the pros and cons of Data Analyst versus Data Scientist as the next step in my career?
   - Result:

   Great question. Both paths can be excellent; the best fit depends on the kind of problems you enjoy, your current skills, and how you want to spend your day.

Quick distinction
- Data Analyst: Translates data into decisions. Heavy on SQL/BI, dashboards, ad‑hoc analysis, business partnering, experimentation basics.
- Data Scientist: Builds and validates predictive/causal models and experiments. Heavier on Python/R, statistics, ML, and often some engineering.

Pros and cons

Data Analyst
- Pros:
  - Clear business impact and quicker feedback loops
  - Lower barrier to entry; faster to become productive
  - Strong stakeholder exposure and storytelling practice
  - Market demand across many industries and company sizes
- Cons:
  - Typically lower compensation ceiling than DS
  - Risk of being “report factory” if you don’t shape the questions
  - Less time on advanced modeling; possible growth plateau unless you specialize (e.g., experimentation, analytics engineering)

Data Scientist
- Pros:
  - Higher compensation upside in many markets
  - Deep technical work (ML, causal inference, experimentation)
  - Broader career doors (ML engineering, product DS, research, MLOps)
  - High leverage when models or experimentation drive product/ops
- Cons:
  - Higher barrier to entry (math/stats/coding, production experience)
  - Role variance: some “DS” jobs are actually analyst roles; others require full ML engineering
  - ROI can be longer; dependent on data/engineering maturity to deploy models
  - Job market can be spiky and competitive

Day-to-day differences (reality check)
- Analyst: SQL, BI dashboards (Looker/Power BI/Tableau), defining metrics, ad‑hoc deep dives, stakeholder meetings, basic A/B test reads, data hygiene.
- Scientist: Notebooks and Python/R, feature engineering, model selection/validation, experiment design/analysis, reading/implementing methods, partnering with engineering for deployment.

Skill emphasis
- Both: SQL, data modeling basics, business acumen, clear communication, experimental thinking.
- Analyst-leaning: BI tools, dbt/ETL basics, metric design, stakeholder management, SQL performance, A/B testing interpretation.
- Scientist-leaning: Probability/statistics, linear algebra, Python, scikit‑learn/PyTorch, causal inference/experimentation, feature stores, ML ops basics, cloud.

Career paths
- Analyst: Senior Analyst → Analytics Lead/Manager → Product Analyst/Decision Scientist → Analytics Engineer or move into DS/PM.
- Scientist: Data Scientist → Senior/Staff → Product DS/ML Engineer → Tech Lead/Manager, or MLOps/Platform.

Market notes
- Many “Product Data Scientist” roles focus on experimentation, metrics, and SQL/statistics—great bridge between analyst and DS.
- “ML Engineer” skews more software/infra than classic DS.
- Read JDs carefully: deployment, feature stores, online inference = real DS/ML; dashboards/reporting-heavy = analyst.

Automation risk
- Analysts: Generative AI speeds up SQL, charts, summaries—your edge is problem framing, metric design, and influencing decisions.
- Scientists: AutoML/LLMs help with modeling—but experiment design, causal reasoning, data quality, and productionizing remain hard and valuable.

How to choose quickly
- Lean Analyst if you enjoy: partnering with business, fast iteration, clear questions/answers, shaping metrics and decisions, less interest in heavy math/engineering.
- Lean Scientist if you enjoy: coding and math, ambiguity, experimentation, building/validating models, and you want a steeper technical learning curve.

Try-before-you-commit (2–3 week sprints)
- Analyst trial: Pick a business question, model the data, design the metrics, build a dashboard with drill‑downs, and present a recommendation.
- Scientist trial: Ship an end‑to‑end ML or causal project: define the problem, baseline, model, validation, and a deployment mock (API or batch), with a write‑up of assumptions and tradeoffs.
- Notice which work gives you energy and which frustrations feel “good hard” vs “draining hard.”

Action plans

If you choose Analyst:
- Build 2–3 portfolio pieces: metric framework, executive dashboard, and an A/B test readout with clear recommendations.
- Tools: SQL mastery, one BI tool, dbt basics, experimentation concepts, storytelling.
- Aim for roles with ownership: product analytics, decision science, or analytics engineering to avoid pure reporting.

If you choose Scientist:
- Shore up math/stats, Python, and ML fundamentals; implement 3–4 projects with rigorous validation and a deployment story.
- Learn experiment design, causal inference, and basics of MLOps/cloud.
- Target teams that ship models or run heavy experimentation (read the JD for deployment/feature pipeline signals).

If you’re still unsure, consider hybrids:
- Product Data Scientist (experimentation-forward)
- Analytics Engineer (SQL/dbt/warehouse engineering)
- Decision Scientist (business-first analytics with strong stats)

Happy to tailor this. A few quick questions:
- What’s your current background (tools, years of experience, industries)?
- Which do you enjoy more: deep coding/math or partnering with stakeholders to drive decisions?
- How soon do you want to transition, and do you need a pay bump immediately?
- Do you have access to data projects at work you could use to “trial” either path?


3. Prompt:
Draft a polite follow-up text message to a my wife who hasn't responded

   - Result:

Here are a few gentle, polite follow-up options. Pick the tone that feels most like you:

- Hey [her name], just checking in to see if you saw my last message. No rush—hope your day’s going smoothly.
- Hi [her name], hope you’re doing okay. When you have a minute, could you let me know you got my last text?
- Hey [her name], I know you’re probably busy—just wanted to touch base and say I’m thinking of you. Reply whenever you can.
- Hi [her name], not sure if my last text went through. When you get a chance, a quick update would be great. Love you.

#### ❓Question #2:

Are the vibes of this assistant's answers aligned with your vibes? Why or why not?
##### ✅ Answer:

Wow, I'm very surprised by the good answers, in some ways exactly as I think...

---

#### 🏗️ Activity #3: Personal Vibe Checking Evals (Requires Additional Capabilities)

Now test your assistant with questions that would require capabilities beyond basic chat, such as access to external tools, APIs, or real-time data. Try prompts like:

- "What does my schedule look like tomorrow?"
- "What time should I leave for the airport?"

##### Your Prompts and Results:
1. Prompt:
I'd like to finish the new lab tomorrow that we're getting today, it takes about 1 hour. Take the kid swimming in the afternoon and maybe do 45 minutes at the gym, I'm at work from 9am-5pm


   - Result:
   Great plan. Here are two clean options for tomorrow that fit work 9–5, the 1-hour lab, kid swimming in the afternoon, and a 45-minute gym session.

Option A: Morning gym, lab before lunch
- 6:45 Wake, quick breakfast
- 7:15–8:00 Gym (45 min) + quick shower
- 9:00–10:00 Work
- 10:00–11:00 New lab (1 hour, focused block)
- 11:00–12:00 Work
- 12:00–1:00 Lunch
- 1:00–5:00 Work
- 5:30–6:30 Kid swimming (adjust start as needed + travel)
- 7:00 Dinner and unwind

Option B: Evening gym, lab mid-morning
- 6:45 Wake, morning routine
- 9:00–10:30 Work
- 10:30–11:30 New lab (1 hour)
- 11:30–5:00 Work (break for lunch as usual)
- 5:30–6:30 Kid swimming
- 7:15–8:00 Gym (45 min) or do gym during lunch (12:15–1:00) if that’s easier

Quick setup tips:
- Pack swim and gym bags tonight; put them by the door.
- Block the lab on your calendar so it doesn’t get bumped.
- Add 15–30 minutes buffer for travel around swim/gym as needed.

Want me to lock this in more precisely? Let me know:
- Exact swim time and travel time
- Whether the lab needs to be during work hours or can be done at lunch/after work
- Preference: morning or evening gym

2. Prompt:
I would like to go to Paris this week for a meeting on Wednesday or Thursday  I am flying from Zagreb. What time should I leave for the airport?

   - Result:
   Great plan. Let’s make it low‑stress.

Quick rule of thumb for Zagreb (ZAG) to Paris (CDG/ORY):
- Aim to be at the airport 2 hours before departure (2.5–3 hours if checking a bag or traveling at peak times).
- Add your travel time to ZAG: 
  - Car/taxi from central Zagreb: about 30–40 minutes; add 15–20 minutes in rush hour.
  - Airport bus from the main bus station: about 35–45 minutes, plus buffer for the bus timing.

Example:
- If your flight departs at 10:00, target arrival at the airport by 08:00. Leave central Zagreb around 06:45–07:00 by car/taxi (earlier if checking a bag or heavy traffic).

If you share:
- exact departure time and day,
- whether you’re checking a bag,
- how you’ll get to the airport and where you’re coming from,
I’ll give you a precise “leave by” time.

Mental ease tip: if your meeting is in the morning, consider flying the evening before—arriving rested usually leads to a better meeting.

#### ❓Question #3:

What are some limitations of your application?
